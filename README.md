##Assignment Two — The game of Connect Four 

###Software Design and Programming 2015

###Learning objectives
• Experience developing code using trees and recursion.

• Learn about the minimax algorithm.

• Develop an awareness for how computationally infeasible it may be to enumerate all possible paths of a game.

• Further practice with the functional programming paradigm.

###Your task

There are two parts to this assignment.

1. First, you have to familiarise yourself with the classes we give you. That includes writing two methods so that the game can be played. Then, two humans can play, the computer can play against itself using a dumb method that plays randomly, or a human can play against the dumb method.

2. The second part consists of writing methods that implement an AI (artificial intelligence) technique called the minimax algorithm. (See: http://ai-depot.com/ articles/minimax-explained/ and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax)
